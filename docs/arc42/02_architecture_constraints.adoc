== 2. Architecture Constraints

[role="arc42help"]
****
Any requirement that constrains software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the development process.
****

=== 2.1 Technical Constraints

[cols="1,2,3" options="header"]
|===
| Constraint | Background | Consequences

| **Browser-only Application** 
| Cross-platform requirement, PWA capability, no server infrastructure
| Must use web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript), PWA APIs for offline capability

| **Client-side Processing** 
| Privacy, security, and offline capability requirements
| All document processing in browser, limited to ~2GB PDF files (professional scanner capacity)

| **PWA-capable Architecture** 
| Installation option for desktop users, offline functionality
| Service Worker implementation, IndexedDB for persistent storage, app manifest

| **Multi-platform UI Support** 
| Touch and mouse interaction support for mobile and desktop with simple interactions
| Responsive design, single-click interactions, no complex gesture requirements
|===

=== 2.2 Organizational Constraints

[cols="1,2,3" options="header"]
|===
| Constraint | Background | Consequences

| **Open Source Development** 
| Community-driven development, transparency, collaborative improvement
| Public repository, open development process, permissive licensing

| **Self-hosted Deployment** 
| Power users require local installation and control
| Static file hosting capability, offline-first architecture

| **Demo Accessibility** 
| GitHub Pages hosting for testing and demonstration
| Static deployment without server dependencies

| **Multi-deployment Strategy** 
| Support for demo, self-hosted, and desktop installation
| Flexible deployment options, PWA installation capability

=== 2.3 Conventions

[role="arc42help"]
****
Programming and development conventions, architectural patterns, and documentation standards.
****

==== Development Standards

**Code Quality:**
* Modern JavaScript (ES2020+) with strict mode
* Consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes)
* Comprehensive error handling and input validation
* Unit tests for all core functionality
* ESLint + Prettier for code formatting

**Architecture Patterns:**
* Component-based architecture for UI elements
* Event-driven communication between modules
* Dependency injection for testability
* Clean separation of concerns (processing, UI, storage)

==== Documentation Standards

**Technical Documentation:**
* arc42 template for architecture documentation
* ADR (Architecture Decision Records) for major decisions
* JSDoc comments for all public APIs
* README-driven development approach

**User Documentation:**
* Interactive tutorials within the application
* Context-sensitive help system
* Video demonstrations for complex workflows
