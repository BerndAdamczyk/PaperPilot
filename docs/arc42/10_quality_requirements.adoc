== 10. Quality Requirements

[role="arc42help"]
****
The quality requirements specify the quality attributes (non-functional requirements) that the system must fulfill to meet the stakeholder needs.
****

=== 10.1 Quality Tree

****
The quality tree shows the quality goals and their refinement. The top level contains the quality categories, the second level shows the quality subcategories.

=== 10.2 Quality Scenarios

[role="arc42help"]
****
Quality scenarios describe concrete situations that serve as test cases for quality attributes. Each scenario consists of:
* Source of stimulus
* Stimulus
* Environment
* Artifact
* Response
* Response measure
****

==== Functionality Scenarios

[cols="1,3,2" options="header"]
|===
| ID | Scenario | Measure

| **F1** 
| **Document Processing Accuracy**: User uploads a 50-page PDF with mixed content and QR codes. System processes document with QR splitting enabled and correctly identifies all QR codes without data loss.
| 99% accuracy in QR code detection, zero data corruption

| **F2** 
| **Blank Page Detection**: Document contains blank or nearly blank pages. System identifies and removes them without false positives across various document qualities.
| <1% false positive rate, >95% detection accuracy
|===

==== Reliability Scenarios

[cols="1,3,2" options="header"]
|===
| ID | Scenario | Measure

| **R1** 
| **Large Document Processing**: User uploads 1.5GB PDF (professional scanner capacity) in browser with standard memory. System processes without crashing or memory errors.
| Successfully processes documents up to 2GB

| **R2** 
| **Crash Recovery**: Browser crashes during PDF generation. System detects incomplete processing state and resumes from last completed document.
| 100% recovery from crashes with resumable processing state
|===

==== Usability Scenarios

[cols="1,3,2" options="header"]
|===
| ID | Scenario | Measure

| **U1** 
| **First-time User Experience**: New user with no prior experience attempts to process their first document using standard desktop browser.
| 90% of users complete basic task within 5 minutes without help

| **U2** 
| **Intuitive State Management**: User processes document and cycles through page states with single clicks, inserts split points between pages without confusion.
| 95% of users understand state cycling without instruction, zero accidental bulk changes

| **U3** 
| **Progress Feedback**: User processes large 800-page document and receives clear progress indication per output document being generated.
| Progress updates every 2 seconds, accurate ETA within 20%, resumable after interruption
|===

==== Performance Scenarios

[cols="1,3,2" options="header"]
|===
| ID | Scenario | Measure

| **P1** 
| **Processing Speed**: 100-page PDF document processed with all features enabled on modern desktop browser.
| <2 seconds per page for standard documents

| **P2** 
| **UI Responsiveness**: User interacts with interface (clicks, settings) while background processing is active.
| UI response time <100ms during intensive processing
|===

==== Security Scenarios

[cols="1,3,2" options="header"]
|===
| ID | Scenario | Measure

| **S1** 
| **Data Privacy**: User processes confidential documents through complete workflow. No data transmitted externally.
| Network monitoring shows zero external requests

| **S2** 
| **Data Cleanup**: Analysis data stored in IndexedDB for 30 days. System automatically cleans up old analysis data and provides manual cleanup options.
| Configurable data retention, complete cleanup capability, no orphaned data
