=== 9.1 Decision Overview

This section documents key architectural decisions made during PaperPilot development. Each decision includes context, options considered, decision made, and consequences.

=== 9.2 Architecture Decision Records

==== ADR-001: Client-side Processing Architecture

**Date:** 2025-06-23 +
**Status:** ✅ Accepted

**Context:**
Document digitization involves handling potentially sensitive information (legal documents, medical records, personal papers). Users need assurance that their documents remain completely private and secure.

**Decision:**
All document processing will be performed client-side in the user's browser, with zero server-side processing or data transmission.

**Alternatives Considered:**
* Server-side processing with file upload
* Hybrid approach with optional cloud processing
* Desktop application with local processing

**Consequences:**
* ✅ Complete document privacy - no data leaves user's device
* ✅ No server infrastructure required - reduced costs and complexity
* ✅ Works offline - no internet dependency after initial load
* ❌ Limited by browser performance and memory constraints
* ❌ Cannot leverage powerful server-side processing tools
* ❌ Larger client-side application bundle size

==== ADR-002: Modern Web Technologies Stack

**Date:** 2025-06-23 +
**Status:** ✅ Accepted

**Context:**
Need cross-platform compatibility without requiring native application installations. Target users need immediate access without complex setup procedures.

**Decision:**
Use modern web technologies: HTML5, CSS3, vanilla JavaScript (ES2020+), with minimal external dependencies.

**Alternatives Considered:**
* Electron desktop application
* React/Vue.js framework
* Native mobile applications
* Progressive Web App with framework

**Consequences:**
* ✅ Universal compatibility across platforms and devices
* ✅ Easy deployment and automatic updates
* ✅ No installation required for end users
* ✅ Smaller development team requirements
* ❌ Limited to browser capabilities and APIs
* ❌ Requires modern browser support
* ❌ More complex state management without framework

==== ADR-003: PDF.js for PDF Processing

**Date:** 2025-06-23 +
**Status:** ✅ Accepted

**Context:**
PDF is the primary format for scanned documents requiring reliable parsing, manipulation, and generation capabilities in the browser environment.

**Decision:**
Use Mozilla's PDF.js library for all PDF processing and manipulation tasks.

**Alternatives Considered:**
* Custom PDF parsing implementation
* Server-side PDF processing with API calls
* PDF-lib.js library
* jsPDF for generation only

**Consequences:**
* ✅ Mature, well-tested library with extensive PDF support
* ✅ Pure JavaScript implementation - no external dependencies
* ✅ Active development and community support
* ✅ Comprehensive feature set for reading and writing PDFs
* ❌ Large library size (~2MB) impacts initial load time
* ❌ Complex API requiring learning curve
* ❌ Some advanced PDF features not supported

==== ADR-004: Component-based UI Architecture

**Date:** 2025-06-23 +
**Status:** ✅ Accepted

**Context:**
Need maintainable, testable user interface with reusable elements. Application will have complex UI with multiple views and interactions.

**Decision:**
Implement component-based architecture using vanilla JavaScript classes with standardized lifecycle and communication patterns.

**Alternatives Considered:**
* Monolithic JavaScript with jQuery
* React.js component framework
* Vue.js component framework
* Web Components standard

**Consequences:**
* ✅ Reusable, maintainable code structure
* ✅ Clear separation of concerns and responsibilities
* ✅ Easier unit testing of individual components
* ✅ No framework dependency or bundle size increase
* ❌ More initial setup complexity and conventions needed
* ❌ Requires disciplined coding practices and documentation
* ❌ Manual state management between components

==== ADR-005: Web Workers for Background Processing

**Date:** 2025-06-23 +
**Status:** ✅ Accepted

**Context:**
Document processing (QR detection, image analysis, PDF manipulation) can be CPU-intensive and block the user interface, creating poor user experience.

**Decision:**
Use Web Workers for all intensive processing tasks to maintain UI responsiveness.

**Alternatives Considered:**
* Synchronous processing with loading indicators
* setTimeout-based task chunking
* RequestAnimationFrame-based processing
* Service Worker for background processing

**Consequences:**
* ✅ Non-blocking user interface during processing
* ✅ Better user experience with responsive controls
* ✅ Ability to cancel long-running operations
* ✅ Progress reporting from background threads
* ❌ Additional complexity in data serialization and transfer
* ❌ Limited browser API access from worker threads
* ❌ Debugging complexity across multiple threads
