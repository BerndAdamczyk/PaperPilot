== 4. Solution Strategy

[role="arc42help"]
****
A short summary and explanation of the fundamental decisions and solution strategies that shape the system's architecture.
****

=== 4.1 Technology Decisions

[cols="1,2,3" options="header"]
|===
| Decision | Rationale | Consequences

| **Pure Web Technologies** 
| Cross-platform compatibility without installation requirements
| Universal accessibility, standard web development skills, browser limitations

| **Client-side Processing** 
| Data privacy, zero server infrastructure, offline capability
| Complete privacy, no hosting costs, limited by browser performance

| **Component Architecture** 
| Maintainable, testable, reusable code structure
| Clear responsibility boundaries, easier debugging, modular development

| **PDF.js Library** 
| Mature, reliable PDF processing in browsers
| Large library size, but comprehensive PDF support without server dependencies
|===

=== 4.2 Architectural Patterns

**Event-Driven Architecture:**
* Loose coupling between processing modules
* Asynchronous processing with progress notifications
* Easy extension with new processing modules

**Pipeline Pattern:**
* Document processing as a series of transformation steps
* Each step can be configured, skipped, or customized
* Clear data flow and error handling at each stage

**Observer Pattern:**
* UI components react to processing state changes
* Progress tracking and real-time feedback
* Separation of business logic from presentation

[cols="1,3" options="header"]
|===
| Quality Goal | Solution Approach

| **Reliability** 
| • Comprehensive error handling at each processing step
• Input validation and sanitization
• Recovery mechanisms for interrupted processing
• Automated testing of core functionality

| **Usability** 
| • Drag-and-drop interface with visual feedback
• Single-click state cycling for intuitive page management
• Scrollable thumbnail grid with color-coded frames
• Non-destructive preview before final processing
• Manual intervention capabilities for edge cases

| **Performance** 
| • Web Workers for CPU-intensive tasks
• Lazy loading of large documents
• Efficient memory management with cleanup
• Progress indicators for long-running operations

| **Security** 
| • All processing happens locally in browser
• No data transmission to external servers
• Secure memory cleanup after processing
• Input validation against malicious content

| **Cross-platform** 
| • Standard web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, ES2020+)
• Progressive enhancement for older browsers
• Responsive design for various screen sizes
• Feature detection and graceful degradation

=== 4.4 Top-level Decomposition

**Three-Layer Architecture:**

1. **Presentation Layer** (UI Components)
   - User interface and interaction handling
   - Progress visualization and feedback
   - Configuration panels and dialogs

2. **Business Logic Layer** (Processing Engine)
   - Document analysis and processing
   - QR code detection and extraction
   - Blank page identification
   - Document splitting and organization

3. **Data Access Layer** (File Management)
   - File I/O operations
   - Browser storage management
   - Format conversion and export

This decomposition ensures clear separation of concerns and enables independent development and testing of each layer.
