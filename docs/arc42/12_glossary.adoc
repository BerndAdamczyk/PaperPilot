=== 12.1 Business Domain Terms

**Batch Processing**::
Processing multiple documents or operations as a group rather than individually, improving efficiency for high-volume workflows.

**Blank Page Detection**::
Algorithm that identifies pages with no or minimal content, typically used to remove empty pages from scanned documents to reduce file size and improve organization.

**Document Digitization**::
Process of converting physical documents into digital format through scanning and processing, often including OCR, metadata extraction, and format conversion.

**Document Splitting**::
Process of dividing a single document into multiple separate documents based on specific criteria such as QR codes, blank pages, or content markers.

**High-volume Documents**::
Large collections of documents that require efficient processing methods due to their quantity, typically requiring batch processing and automation.

**Non-destructive Preview**::
Preview mode that allows users to review and modify operations without permanently altering the original document until explicitly confirmed.

**QR Code (Quick Response Code)**::
Two-dimensional barcode that can store information (text, URLs, metadata) and be read by cameras or scanners, used as document markers in PaperPilot.

=== 12.2 Technical Terms

**Canvas API**::
HTML5 API that provides a drawing surface for graphics, used for image manipulation, rendering, and pixel-level operations in browsers.

**Client-side Processing**::
Computing operations performed on the user's device (browser) rather than on a remote server, ensuring data privacy and reducing server dependencies.

**IndexedDB**::
Browser-based database API for storing large amounts of structured data locally, used for temporary storage of documents during processing.

**PDF.js**::
Mozilla's JavaScript library for parsing and rendering PDF documents in web browsers without plugins, enabling client-side PDF manipulation.

**Progressive Web App (PWA)**::
Web application that uses modern web capabilities to provide native app-like experience, including offline functionality and installation options.

**Single Page Application (SPA)**::
Web application that dynamically updates content without requiring full page reloads, providing smoother user experience.

**Web Workers**::
JavaScript API that allows running scripts in background threads, preventing blocking of the main user interface during intensive operations.
