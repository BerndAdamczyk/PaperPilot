[role="arc42help"]
****
A list of identified technical risks or technical debts, ordered by priority.
****

=== 11.1 Risk Assessment

==== High Priority Risks

[cols="1,2,1,2,2" options="header"]
|===
| Risk | Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy

| **Memory Limitations** 
| Large documents (>1.5GB) may exceed browser memory limits during processing
| High 
| Medium 
| Progressive processing, chunked operations, streaming PDF generation, partial output storage

| **Storage Persistence** 
| IndexedDB analysis data may become orphaned if original PDFs are moved/deleted
| High 
| Low 
| Automatic cleanup after 30 days, manual cleanup tools, storage usage monitoring

| **PWA Installation** 
| Users may not understand PWA installation process or capability
| Medium 
| Low 
| Clear installation prompts, fallback to browser usage, installation tutorials
|===

==== Medium Priority Risks

[cols="1,2,1,2,2" options="header"]
|===
| Risk | Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy

| **QR Code Detection Accuracy** 
| QR codes may not be detected reliably in poor quality scans
| Medium 
| Medium 
| Multiple detection algorithms, user manual override, quality preprocessing

| **Third-party Dependencies** 
| PDF.js or QR detection libraries may become outdated or incompatible
| Low 
| High 
| Regular dependency updates, fallback implementations, vendor evaluation

| **User Adoption** 
| Users may prefer existing server-based solutions
| Medium 
| Medium 
| Clear privacy value proposition, comprehensive documentation, user testimonials

=== 11.2 Technical Debt

==== Current Technical Debt

**ðŸ”´ High Priority Debt**

[cols="1,2,2,1" options="header"]
|===
| Item | Description | Resolution Plan | Timeline

| **Missing Test Coverage** 
| No automated test suite for core processing modules
| Implement Jest-based unit tests for all modules, integration tests for workflows
| Sprint 2

| **Error Handling Gaps** 
| Incomplete error handling in PDF processing and QR detection
| Add comprehensive try-catch blocks, user-friendly error messages, recovery options
| Sprint 1

| **Performance Monitoring** 
| No performance metrics or monitoring for processing operations
| Add performance.mark() timing, memory usage tracking, user feedback collection
| Sprint 3
|===

**ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority Debt**

[cols="1,2,2,1" options="header"]
|===
| Item | Description | Resolution Plan | Timeline

| **Code Documentation** 
| Insufficient JSDoc comments for public APIs
| Add comprehensive JSDoc for all public methods and classes
| Ongoing

| **Configuration Management** 
| Hard-coded processing parameters, no user customization
| Implement settings system with persistence, user preference management
| Sprint 4

| **Accessibility Compliance** 
| UI not tested for screen readers or keyboard navigation
| WCAG 2.1 audit, keyboard navigation implementation, ARIA attributes
| Post-MVP
|===

**ðŸŸ¢ Low Priority Debt**

* **Internationalization**: UI only available in English
* **Advanced Features**: Limited configuration options for power users
* **Mobile Optimization**: Interface not optimized for mobile devices
* **Offline Support**: No service worker for offline functionality

=== 11.3 Debt Prevention Strategy

==== Quality Gates

**Pre-commit Checks:**
* ESLint validation for code quality
* Unit test execution for changed modules
* JSDoc validation for public APIs
* Performance regression detection

**Release Criteria:**
* >80% test coverage for core modules
* Zero high-severity security vulnerabilities
* Browser compatibility verification (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
* Performance benchmarks within acceptable limits

=== 11.4 Risk Monitoring

**Continuous Monitoring:**

[cols="1,2,2" options="header"]
|===
| Area | Monitoring Method | Review Frequency

| **Browser Compatibility** 
| Automated cross-browser testing, user agent analytics
| Weekly

| **Performance** 
| Processing time benchmarks, memory usage tracking
| Daily during development

| **User Feedback** 
| Error reporting, user satisfaction surveys
| Bi-weekly

| **Dependencies** 
| Automated vulnerability scanning, update notifications
| Daily
|===

**Escalation Criteria:**
* Processing failure rate >5%
* Memory crashes in >10% of large document operations
* User-reported compatibility issues in supported browsers
* Critical security vulnerabilities in dependencies
